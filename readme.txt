To play the games, you just need to click the 'play' button and select the game you want to play from the list.

There are 4 games in each catagory, Beginner and Advanced.
The games are a general knowledge quiz, a puzzle quiz, a number finding game, hangman and Simon Says.


There are 'back to menu' buttons on some games. 
The back button on the quiz reloads the page so you must click the 'play' button once again to select a new game.


/* Bugs */

On some games we couldnt get the 'back button' to work.
There are two main bugs that are stopping the numbers game in beginner and advanced from showing in the pop up window.
There is a problem with the css on both the beginner and advanced Memory Games but both games run properly.
